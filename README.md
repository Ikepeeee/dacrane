# Gantry Crane

Gantry Crane is an open-source tool for integrating container infrastructure, build, release and deployment.

We, developers, don't want to write down deployment procedures and dependencies between our applications and infrastructure in a procedure document.
Such procedures are redundant and out of date.
A lot of time is lost by maintaining and manually testing them.

However, developers only want to deploy and deliver value to their users, and Gantry Crane answers this need.
By managing deployments with only declarative code and simple commands, developers can focus on delivering value.
The code can be easily replicated for development, staging, production, etc.

Gantry Crane is currently in the early stages of development.
