## Abstract/Concrete Deployment Code (ADC/CDC)

To meet the requirement of an easily replicable environment, Gantry Crane uses two types of codes: abstract deployment code (ADC) and concrete deployment code (CDC).

The ADC is a configuration definition that is separate from the infrastructure and application entities and contains information such as what infrastructure the application will be deployed to.
On the other hand, a CDC is a configuration definition that corresponds to the actual infrastructure and application.

The ADC is committed and managed in a code repository, while the CDC is managed on a separate file server (such as a local PC file system or AWS S3).
This allows for separation of per-environment deployment settings from the repository, eliminating the need to maintain environment-related files such as local.yaml, stg.yaml, prd.yaml, etc.

For example, ADC defines that the application will be deployed to App Services, but does not specifically specify Azure tenants or resource groups. These values are defined separately as environment variables.
